This is an international interconnect report similar to the one Palestine Wataniya(425_6) has. I think we can re-use most part of code of 425_6, as in watainiya, there are trunk pattern, but in 472_2, not has trunk pattern. But I have some items needing to be confirmed. 
1. carrier should show in portal, right?
2. international trunk should be summaried in this report. therefore please confirm international trunk list as attached image.
3. it's daily report, and go to hourly report via drilling down link as 425_6, right?
